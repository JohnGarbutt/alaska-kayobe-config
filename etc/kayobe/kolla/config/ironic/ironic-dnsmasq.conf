# The NIC in the Dell C4130 servers used for the GPU nodes sends a DHCP client
# ID (option 61) which is not the recommended hardware type and MAC address
# (one has been observed sending "DELLT^@^PFM-^@YM-8M-@O3J2"). When the
# inspection ramdisk is booted, it sends a DHCP discover packet with a client
# ID of the 01:<MAC address> format. Dnsmasq logs that it will send an offer
# for this host but nothing is sent on the wire. It appears this is due to an
# existing entry in the leases database for the host's MAC address that uses a
# different client ID.
#
# Here we match on the Intel vendor ID and use the magic client ID '*' to
# instruct dnsmasq to ignore index the lease database using MAC addresses
# rather than client IDs for these hosts.
